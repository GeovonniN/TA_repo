Let \\\(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{100}\\\) be the outcomes of \\\(100\\\) independent rolls of a fair coin.

\\\[P(X_i=0)=P(X_i=1)=0.5\\\]

Define the random variable \\\(X\\\) to be \\\(X_1 - X_2\\\).

3.\\\(\mathbb{E}(X) = \\\)

   *Hint:* if \\\(X,Y\\\) are independent random variables then \\\(var(X+Y)=var(X)+var(Y)\\\)

Define the random variable \\\(Y = X_1 - 2X_2 + X_3\\\).

   *Hint:* if \\\(a\\\) is a constant and \\\(X\\\) a random variable, then \\\(var(aX)=a^2 var(X)\\\).

Define the random variable \\\(Z = X_1 - X_2 + X_3 - X_4 + ... + X_{$n-1} - X_{$n}\\\).
